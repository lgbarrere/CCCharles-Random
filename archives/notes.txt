Found bugs :
    > When the train_key is interacted, all already received items are received once again
    > Eggs duplicate at game restart
    > If the player goes to any mine exit with its egg in inventory, its mission states update making its NPC not giving his item
    > When a weapon is equipped, it's not hidden on equipper
    > If Boomer_Rockets is received, mission state 3.3 is active : the out bunker door disapears at level reload
        => Reactivate Boomer_ClickBox3 at game restart to fix it
    > The player cannot talk to NPCs with a key if a mine is exited with an egg in inventory

TODO :
    1) Make a datastorage to send locally found items when reconnected to Archipelago (*)
    (*) Also applicable if ItemReceivedEvent is not called, to gather missed items by the event
