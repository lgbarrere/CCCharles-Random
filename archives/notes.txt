Found bugs :
    > In a new game, if i come back to a NPC who already gave its item, he gives the base item (randomization disabled)
    > When a weapon is equipped, it's not hidden on equipper

Not found scraps :

TODO :
    1) Remove the scrap_santiago_18 (glitched) from the list of checks
    2) Change the randomization logic of mission ends
    3) Make a datastorage to send locally found items when reconnected to Archipelago (*)

To get a working local world :
1) Package the <apworld>/ folder (here cccharles) and name it <apworld>.apworld (the archipelago logo should be displayed)
2) Double-click the <apworld>.apworld package to automatically install the world locally
3) Launch the Archipelago launcher and click "Generate Template Options"
4) Put the generated template from Archipelago/Players/Templates/ to Archipelago/Players/ and edit it manually
5) In the Archipelago launcher, click "Generate" to setup a game with the yaml in the Archipelago/ouput/ folder
6) The game can now be hosted with "Host" in the Archipelago launcher by using the generated game in Archipelago/output/
