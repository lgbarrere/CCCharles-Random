Found bugs :
    > After game restart, items are not restored when a "Scraps" is received before the game starts
    > The Paint Cans randomly do not appear after a game reload
    > If Boomer_Rockets is received, mission state 3.3 is active : the out bunker door disapears at level reload
        => Reactivate Boomer_ClickBox3 at game restart to fix it
    > In Qwerty, the console does not trigger, the keys "~" and "`" should be mapped too
    > Some scraps are sometimes not correctly picked for unknown reason
    > caravan_scraps_3 did not spawn in a playtest, unknown scrap suspected to have the same name

TODO :
    1) Set a cap to received mission items, for instance in case 9 "Page Drawing" are received, limit them to 8
    2) Name with whitespaces are not allowed in the current code, a fix could be a use of '\"'
    3) Add a Yaml option to enable the end if the bombs are on the bridge (and add invisible collision on the prism)
    (*) Also applicable if ItemReceivedEvent is not called, to gather missed items by the event

Ideas :
> Change the scraps checks from single to 1-5 (yaml reliant) scraps to get one check, making the scraps more important to check
> Change keys into "key fragments" (5 per key for instance, yaml reliant), each fragment will be a check
> Make a compass (could be found in a check if enabled in yaml) to find the closest check to do
> Implement a scraps count by area if possible, always displayed in the screen/map (all counts displayed on the map)
> Make some checks to enable the train upgrade
> DeathDuck has an untextured eye, the Archipelago logo could be added to it
> Make an additional check to randomize the access to the train
> Make the player start with a random weapon (among the 4 weapons)
> Give an option to see randomized items or not (replaced by DeathDuck)
> Paint can could apply a passive effect (positive or negative) or trap
> Add an option to randomize the NPCs
> Add an option to make the train come back to the start if its HP becomes 0
> Add categories of scraps to repair / buff the speed / buff the damage / buff the armor
> Implement the puzzle in the 2nd mine with the hidden gear to open the harrow
> Update "DeathDuck" to give multiworld items and hints
> Add some trapped DeathDuck ("Unscrap" remove scraps from inventory, "Derailed" lower the train HP by 40, "Guru" spawn a cultist near the player for a short while, ...)
