(1) The version of UE to download must be the same as the version of the project, it can be found by :
- Checking the application version itself :
1) Right-click on the "*Shipping.exe" application
2) "Properties"
3) "Details"
4) "File version" (4.26.2.0 for Choo-Choo Charles, note the last number can be ignored)

3) Launch the game
4) Go to the log files and get the AES key (if no log is generated, the AES key is not necessary)

Use Umodel :
- Display the pak file :
1) Launch umodel_64.exe
2) Copy the path to the pak file <pak path> (from <root>, navigate through <Projectname>/Content/Paks/)
3) To the top bar, paste the <pak path>
4) If AES key is asked, paste it after copying from the log files

> Every used paths and file types by the game must be the same in the UE project
2) Choose a file to mod and reproduce the same path to this file in UE in the "Content" folder
3) Create a file of the same type, it is going to be the one used by the game after modding
4) Proceed to any intended changes in this modded file
(*) Make an instance of this file with the expected exact name of the used file, it can also be renamed, the instance is called instead
5) Click "File" tab > "Cook Content for Windows"
6) Retrieve the cooked Content from UE project folder ("Documents/Unreal Projects/" folder by default), then navigate through "<ProjectName>/Saved/Cooked/WindowsNoEditor/Obscure/Content/"
7) Copy the folder containing the modded file to the "Content/" folder of the original game (in <root>/<ProjectName>/)
