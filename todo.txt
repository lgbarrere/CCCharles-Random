TODO :
* Fix the wrong focus with the Overlay
> Use APCpp to link the game to Archipelago
! It is not possible to get the mission_start from Darly if the ancient_tablet is in inventory => to handle
> Define a distance to randomize the items on the ground
> Disable the given items (original) by the missions
> Update "DeathDuck" to give multiworld items and hints
> Test the inputs of "Use Item"/"Gather Item" with specific items (pages, paint cans, weapons, ...)
> Add some trapped-scraps ("Unscrap" remove scraps from inventory, "Derailed" fix the train to 10 HP, ...)
> Check if "Spawn Rumble Actor" can be used for weapons and paint cans

Ideas :
> Change the scrap checks from single to 1-5 (yaml reliant) scraps to get one check, making the scraps more important to check
> Change keys into "key fragments" (5 per key for instance, yaml reliant), each fragment will be a check
> Make a compass (could be found in a check if enabled in yaml) to find the closest check to do
> Implement a scrap count by area if possible, always displayed in the screen/map (all counts displayed on the map)
> Make some checks to enable the train upgrade
> Highlight the close scraps to the player
> DeathDuck has an untextured eye, the Archipelago logo could be added to it
