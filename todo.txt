TODO :
> Manage the inventory when a location is checked or when an item is received
* Fix the wrong focus with the Overlay
! It is not possible to get the mission_start from Darly if the ancient_tablet is in inventory => to handle
* Define a distance to randomize the items on the ground
> Disable the given items (original) by the missions
> Update "DeathDuck" to give multiworld items and hints
> Add some trapped DeathDuck ("Unscrap" remove scraps from inventory, "Derailed" lower the train HP by 40, "Guru" spawn a cultist near the player for a short while, ...)

Ideas :
> Change the scrap checks from single to 1-5 (yaml reliant) scraps to get one check, making the scraps more important to check
> Change keys into "key fragments" (5 per key for instance, yaml reliant), each fragment will be a check
> Make a compass (could be found in a check if enabled in yaml) to find the closest check to do
> Implement a scrap count by area if possible, always displayed in the screen/map (all counts displayed on the map)
> Make some checks to enable the train upgrade
> DeathDuck has an untextured eye, the Archipelago logo could be added to it
> Make an additional check to randomize the access to the train
> Make the player start with a random weapon (among the 4 weapons)
> Give an option to see randomized items or not (replaced by DeathDuck)
> Paint can could apply a passive effect (positive or negative) or trap
> Add an option to randomize the NPCs
> Add an option to make the train come back to the start if its HP becomes 0
> Add categories of scraps to repair / buff the speed / buff the damage / buff the armor
> Implement the puzzle in the 2nd mine with the hidden gear to open the harrow
